\subsection{Divide}
The first step of the divide and conquer algorithm is the division
of the original problem in sub problems. 

The original set of points will be split in two subsets and each
subset will be split in two subsets. This process will be repeated
until we have three or less points in each subset.
\subsection{Find the closest pair}
To find the closest pair in each subset we only have to perform
three comparison and select the pair of points with the smallest
distance in the subset.
