    This is the report for the High Performance Computing for Data Science course project.

    The goal of the project was to implement a parallel solution for the \textit{closest pair of points} problem
    and evaluate it on the High Performance Computing cluster of the University of Trento.

    In the following sections we will present the problem and we will describe some serial solutions
    for it. Then we will present how we implemented a parallel solution and finally we will present and
    discuss the evaluation of the parallel solution on the HPC cluster.
