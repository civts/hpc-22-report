\section{Main steps towards parallelization}
\label{sec:parallelization}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Design of the parallel solution
  \item Implementation
  \item Benchmark on the HPC@UniTrento cluster
\end{itemize}

To move from serial to parallel we decided to split the ordered
points between all the processes, then each process will perform
the serial algorithm on the subset and will find its local best distance and
finally the distances will be merged and the boundary points will be checked
